    "In this project, you need to build a system that can extract [hyponym and hypernym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponymy_and_hypernymy) from a sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in sentence *Stephen Hawking is a physicist .*, phrase *Stephen Hawking* is the **hyponym** of *physicist*, and *physicist* is the **hypernym** of *Stephen Hawking*.\n",

    "We use [IOB2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging)) scheme to represent the results (i.e., encode the tags), as both hypernyms and hyponyms can be phrases.\n",

    "    - `<UNK_WORD>` is used for those words that can not be found in word embedding.\n",
    "    - we offered the embedding of `<UNK_WORD>` in the embedding file. And `<PAD>` can be randomly initialled. It will not contribute to the loss function or the prediction, thus will not be updated anyway.\n",
    "+ Then for each batch, we can generate the corresponding **tensor** with size `[batch_size, max_sent_len, word_embedding_dim]`. Where `max_sent_len` is the maximum length among sentences in the batch.\n",
